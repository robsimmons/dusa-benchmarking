# Performance tests for Dusa

Collects performance testing for the Dusa language.

Directories:
* `asp/` contains any answer set programming code
* `data/` contains JSON blobs representing test data
* `results/` contains CSV outputs of automated tests

Data:
* `data/test-graphs-200-to-2000-edges.json` was generated by `generate-test-graphs-json.js`. It contains graphs with 200, 400, 600, ..., 2000 edges in five categories. Nodes are always specified as integers 0 <= i < numEdges, and edges always specified as the tuple `[n,m]` with `n < m`.  Random graphs are generated by calculating the probability of an edge existing that makes getting exactly the right number of edges most likely... and then generating graphs until one has exactly the right number of edges:
   - `verysparse-random` has |V| = 1.3|E|
   - `sparse-random` has |V| = 0.5|E| 
   - `sparse-almost-connected` has every edge [n,n+1] except for one in the middle
   - `dense-random` has each edge existing with probability 0.25
   - `fully-connected` has _almost_ every edge, but it breaks out of the for loop enumerating edges early when exactly the desired number of edges shows up, unless there exists an integer number of vertices v such that v(v - 1)/ 2
